### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Im open. You can write [DM me](https://t.me/d4mk0). (sorry, NEW DM - MUTED BY DEFAULT, keep calm)

If u want invite me to any web3 hackathon - PLEASE DO IT!

#### I can write
- everything
- backend code
- solidity smart contracts (not like a pro now)
- analyze code (architecture/security problems)
- write fast scripts for any actions
- memes

#### I think
- Good code it is a good, but bad code which can be written and launched ASAP - is better.
- If u nothing do for me, why I should do something for u?
- We must do what we can, with what we have, where we are.
- Respect your mates!
